i'm a leaf shaped shadow you're the sun / i would miss so much of the world / without the way and all you see / it's the hot bright sunshine / be brave, there's no need to hide / always ours to find, my dear one / h / re in the deep time / land drifts apart in dreams / morning singing, you weave / your hand through the sunbream / we were so far from home / i held your moss-covered stone / and the sun disappeared
