i love to sing to you / in sparkle snow, i know, i know / i move to be with you / it's all i know, i know / i swim the stars around / i'm in the slow huge sound / see me blinking / for all good things / its so like all the sea / it's so, it's so big everything / it's brightening / arms around everything / now we see with love eyes / animals that blend in / to crashing waves in sunlight / in the dream of the sea life / it's young in the bright sky / get stung in the high tide / it's luck when i get shy / the sun is my girl / my summer feeling / i see you turn my sun colors / dreams come true at sea / it's a love you can see / it's a friend you can be / it fell down on me / bright sky breathing loud / not strange light so late / not strange wings you wave / not strange waves that break / not strange sound it makes / not strange winged snail / she's glacier prey / it's holding breath / it's lungfuls in your eyes / sea star chase / it's sinking down / with sounds around / it's blinking in your eyes / everything we've done / it's a dream or it's love / it's the hot bright sunshine
